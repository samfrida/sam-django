          <p class="lead mb-5">I started in the domain name industry 19+ years ago as an in-house Domain Name Attorney for Philips Electronics in NL. In 2004, I started my career in the US, working for registrars in retail, brand protection, and aftermarket space. I also gained tremendous exposure to the world of Registries when I worked for Verisign and Neustar. I am born and raised in Singapore, emigrated to Melbourne, Australiar, undertook her Bachelor of Arts in Social Science and then left to the UK to attend law school at the University of Leeds.  I was called to the UK Bar as a Barrister in 1996. I consider myself a world citizen having traveled, lived and worked in several countries.</p>
